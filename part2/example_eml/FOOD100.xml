                1.Cover a baking sheet with some wax paper.</strong>
            <text>
                You won't be baking these cookies, but you still will need some place to put them. You can also line a cupcake tin with paper cupcake liners. Each cupcake liner will hold one drop of cookie dough.
            </text>
            <text>
                - Consider storing the baking sheet in the refrigerator while you are making the dough. This will make it cold, and allow the cookies to finish sooner.

            <text>
                Stir everything with a spoon or a spatula. Consider cutting the butter into smaller cubes; this will help it melt faster in the next steps.

            <text>
                - If you are allergic to milk, try using almond milk, coconut milk, soy milk, or lactose-free milk instead.
            </text>
            <text>
                - If you don't like peanut butter, you can make chocolate hazelnut cookies instead. Start by reducing the cocoa powder to just 2 tablespoons. You will substitute chocolate hazelnut spread for the peanut butter later.

                Scoop some of the dough out using a tablespoon, then drop it onto the wax paper. The dough will be shaped like clumpy balls. If you want, you can flatten the clumps by pressing down on them with the back of the spoon.

                You want to end up with a thick, consistency. If the batter is too soft, add some more oat or almond flour. If it is too dry, add in some more coconut oil or milk.

            <text>
                If you do not have parchment paper, you can use wax paper instead. Since you will be spreading the batter over this, it might be a good idea to tape the paper to the baking sheet. This will keep the paper in place and prevent it from moving about.

                You want it to be about 7 by 8 inches (17.78 by 20.32 centimeters) and ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) thick. Flatten the edges by pressing them in with a spatula.
